This project aims at predicting the chances of a person being infected with Diabetes. As of now, the parameters used are the Number of Pregnancies, Glucose, Blood Pressure, Skin Thickness, Insulin, BMI, and Age.
Preprocessing of the Data is done, thereby imputing null values, removing outliers, and determining the correlation between various parameters. Various classification algorithms are used to predict the values and I have written the code to automatically chose the best algorithm based on accuracies obtained in each process. The new data obtained, once verified can be added to the table.

Obtained Maximum accuracy of 76.61 percent using Random Forest( Entropy) Algorithm
